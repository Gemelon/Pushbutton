# Pushbutton
The library is used to debounce a pushbutton and interpret the
pushbutton state. If the pushbutton is pressed shortly then the
state "ButtonStateTouch" is returned. if the button is pressed a bit
longer then the state "ButtonStateHold" is returned. If the button is
held more longer then the state "ButtonStateInterval" is returned
in an interval.
